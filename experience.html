<p>Being a student is not as easy as we thought. I have been through ups and downs in my studies. From healthy to sick. From not knowing anything I can do everything. From not having friends to having many friends. As a student, I have had the experience of being bitter or sweet, falling and getting up. The most memorable experience I had was in my 2nd semester of getting sick. And I am not as sick as anyone else who can get treatment at the hospital. While in college, I often saw things that other people did not see and at that time I felt very depressed because many did not believe what I was telling. One day, I fell in the bathroom in college due to being too stressed and I broke my right arm. The doctor gave me two months off. I take advantage of the holidays available. I recover myself because I know no one can restore my spirit except myself and all I need is myself. At that point, I got up because I didnâ€™t want to lose to what I was facing. I do not want to be depressed and I do not want to grieve. I want to be strong for myself. After returning to college, I managed to face all the problems I had. I managed to solve whatever problems came up. I regained my former self. Every day I will read a motivational quote for myself. The final message, no matter what the problem, no matter how painful it is, just get up and be yourself. Because others can not save us except ourselves. Positive thinking is a must to avoid stress. Whatever it is, face it calmly and believe in your own abilities. :)</p>
